[00:00.31] Well the stage was set the sun was sinkin' low down
[00:25.81] 
[00:05.77] As they came to town to face another showdown
[00:13.83] The lawmen cleared the people from the streets
[00:21.98] All you blood-thirsty bystanders, will you try to find your seats?
[00:30.11] Watch 'em Duelin', Doolin-Dalton, high or low, it's all the same
[00:45.44] Easy money and faithless women, you will never kill the pain
[01:15.44] 
[01:01.62] Go down, Bill Doolin, don't you wonder why
[01:09.11] Sooner or later we all have to die?
[01:17.37] Sooner or later, that's a stone-cold fact
[01:24.56] Four men ride out and only three ride back
[02:03.85] The queen of diamonds let you down
[02:20.85] 
[02:07.41] She was just an empty fable
[02:20.91] 
[02:12.07] The queen of hearts you say you never met
[02:20.12] Your twisted fate has found you out and it' finally turned the tables
[02:28.30] Stole your dreams and paid you with regret
[02:35.43] Desperado (it there gonna be anything left, is there gonna be anything?)
[02:43.52] You sealed your fate up a long time ago
[02:47.17] (Ain't it hard when you're all alone in the center ring?)
[02:52.59] Now there's no time left to borrow
[02:56.10] (Is there gonna be anything left?)
[02:58.91] Only stardust (maybe tomorrow)
[03:03.42] Maybe tomorrow
[03:10.62] Maybe tomorrow
[03:27.90] Desperado
[03:36.09] Desperado
[03:40.59] 
[03:44.26] Desperado
[03:52.36] Desperado
[04:00.44] Desperado
[04:09.41] Desperado
[04:17.57] Desperado
[04:25.61] Desperado
[04:33.72] Desperado
