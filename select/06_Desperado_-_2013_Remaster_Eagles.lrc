[00:05.22] Desperado
[00:23.31] Why don't you come to your senses?
[00:28.85] You've been out ridin' fences for so long now
[00:37.04] Oh, you're a hard one
[00:39.58] I know that you got your reasons
[00:43.65] These things that are pleasin' you
[00:49.19] Can hurt you somehow
[00:59.19] 
[00:53.52] Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
[00:58.98] She'll beat you if she's able
[01:02.13] You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
[01:09.18] Now it seems to me some fine things
[01:14.45] Have been laid upon your table
[01:17.83] But you only want the ones that you can't get
[01:40.33] 
[01:24.17] Desperado
[01:28.17] Oh, you ain't gettin' no younger
[01:34.35] Your pain and your hunger
[01:37.86] They're drivin' you home
[01:43.06] Freedom, oh freedom
[01:46.45] Well, that's just some people talkin'
[01:50.26] Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone
[02:15.76] 
[01:57.62] Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime?
[02:04.69] The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
[02:07.93] It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day
[02:11.55] You're losing all your highs and lows
[02:19.44] Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?
[02:39.94] 
[02:28.99] Desperado
[02:33.13] Why don't you come to your senses?
[02:39.02] Come down from your fences
[02:42.94] Open the gate
[02:47.10] It may be rainin'
[02:50.18] But there's a rainbow above you
[02:54.27] You better let somebody love you
[02:58.62] (Let somebody love you)
[03:03.83] You better let somebody love you
[03:08.42] Before it's too late
